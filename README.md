## Introduction
The project presents a landing page of an NGO that deals with the rescue of homeless animals. Their goal is to encourage like-minded people to help too by providing two choices. Those interested can donate directly to the organization or adopt one of the rescued animals. With the money it receives, the organization expands its activities to more settlements and provides more funds with which to fulfill its purpose. The organization carries out the following basic actions: it finds and collects stray animals from the street, gives them food and water, a veterinarian examines them so that if there is any problem it can be fixed in time and finally it takes them to its shelters until a willing family comes to adopt them.
